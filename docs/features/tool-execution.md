# Tool Execution

## Feature ID

`FR-TOOL`

## Behavior Summary

PicoClaw exposes built-in tools to the agent for filesystem access, shell
execution, web search/fetch, media delivery, hardware access, and channel
actions. The registry presents tool schemas to providers and executes tool calls
with context, limits, filtering, and error normalization.

## Reconstruction Notes

- Similarity target: recreate a concurrent tool registry plus built-in tools for filesystem, exec, web, media, hardware, and channel action behavior.
- Core types/functions: `Tool` interface, `ToolRegistry`, tool result types, filesystem tool constructors, exec session manager, web search/fetch providers, and tool schema transforms.
- Runtime ordering: register enabled tools, export provider schemas, validate tool call args/context, enforce path/network/command policies, execute, filter result, normalize output.
- Non-obvious constraints: response-handled tools suppress duplicate assistant text, registry must recover panics, workspace restriction and allow path patterns must be checked before file mutation.

## Requirements

| ID | Level | Requirement | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `FR-TOOL-001` | MUST | Tool registry registration, unregistration, lookup, definition export, cloning, allowlist filtering, and execution are concurrency-safe. | Agent turns can execute tools while discovery changes visibility. |
| `FR-TOOL-002` | MUST | Filesystem tools respect workspace restriction, allow path patterns, file size limits, and operation-specific semantics for read/write/edit/append/list/image/send. | Local file access is powerful and must be bounded. |
| `FR-TOOL-003` | MUST | Exec runs commands with configured timeout and deny/allow patterns, supports managed sessions, and returns captured output or structured failure. | Shell access must be useful and controllable. |
| `FR-TOOL-004` | MUST | Web search selects configured providers, honors result/range options, and web fetch observes fetch limits and private host controls. | Search and fetch must be deterministic from config. |
| `FR-TOOL-005` | MUST | Sensitive-data filtering redacts configured secrets from tool results before model exposure when enabled. | Models must not see credentials through tool output. |
| `FR-TOOL-006` | SHOULD | Media, reaction, message, TTS, and hardware tools return handled responses when user-visible delivery is completed outside normal assistant text. | The agent should not duplicate already-delivered output. |
| `FR-TOOL-007` | MUST | Tool schema transformations preserve provider compatibility for OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, and compatibility adapters. | Provider-specific schemas must not change tool behavior. |

## Data And State Model

Tool state includes visible and hidden registry maps, allowlists, TTL metadata,
tool context, media store references, removable tool entries, exec background
sessions, filesystem roots, web provider config, and redaction caches for
sensitive values.

| Tools | `read_file`, `write_file`, `edit_file`, `append_file`, `list_dir`, `load_image`, `send_file`, `exec`, `web_search`, `web_fetch`, hardware and delivery tools | Built-in tool schemas and execution behavior. | `FR-TOOL-001` through `FR-TOOL-007` |
| HTTP | `/api/tools`, `/api/tools/{name}/state`, `/api/tools/web-search-config` | Launcher tool state and web search configuration. | `FR-TOOL-004` |
| Config | `tools.*` subtrees except MCP, skills, and cron ownership in their feature specs | Tool enablement, limits, providers, filtering, and policies. | `FR-TOOL-002` through `FR-TOOL-006` |
| Frontend | Tool library and web-search configuration pages under `web/frontend/src/components/agent/tools/**` | Browser tool management follows shared frontend API, accessibility, formatting, and route smoke-test rules while preserving tool enablement semantics. | `FR-TOOL-001`, `FR-TOOL-004` |

## Algorithms And Ordering

1. Build the registry from config, registering only enabled tools and preserving discovery tools where allowed.
2. Convert registry definitions to provider-specific tool schemas.
3. On execution, inject context, validate args, enforce security constraints, then call the tool.
4. Recover panics and nil results into normalized tool errors.
5. Apply sensitive-data filtering before returning model-visible content.

## Cross-Feature Behavior

Agent conversations execute tools. MCP and skills add tool-like behavior through
separate features. Hooks can modify, deny, or short-circuit tool calls. Security
policies control credentials, HTTP guards, and isolation. Threads provide a
thread-specific tool and policy surface while relying on the generic registry,
schema export, execution, and settings UI mechanics defined here.

## Failure And Edge Cases

- Missing required tool args return tool errors.
- Panics inside a tool are recovered by the registry.
- Nil tool results are normalized.
- Denied commands and path violations never execute the requested side effect.
- Web providers fail over only according to configured provider behavior.
